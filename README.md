Dataset overview:
The sleep health and lifestyle dataset is comprehensive collection of data on sleep patterns, lifestyle factors and cardiovascular health. There are 13 columns in dataset:

Person ID: An identifier for each individual.

Gender: The gender of the person (Male/Female).

Age: The age of the person in years.

Occupation: The occupation or profession of the person.

Sleep Duration (hours): The number of hours the person sleeps per day.

Quality of Sleep (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.

Physical Activity Level (minutes/day): The number of minutes the person engages in physical activity daily.

Stress Level (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.

BMI Category: The BMI category of the person (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight).

Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic): The blood pressure measurement of the person, indicated as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure.

Heart Rate (bpm): The resting heart rate of the person in beats per minute.

Daily Steps: The number of steps the person takes per day.

Sleep Disorder: The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).

Dataset Objectives
The primary objective of this dataset is to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between sleep patterns, lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular health. Specifically, the dataset can be used to:

Investigate the association between sleep disorders (Insomnia, Sleep Apnea) and cardiovascular health indicators such as blood pressure and heart rate.

Explore the impact of lifestyle factors (physical activity, stress) on sleep duration and quality.

Examine the relationship between sleep duration, sleep quality, and blood pressure across different demographic groups (age, gender, BMI).

Conclusion
Gender:

The females are more likely to experience 'Sleep Apnea' than males it might because females have higher blood pressure and heart rate as compared to males and also, as we have seen that the Sleep Apnea is more skewed towards older group so, this maybe because of the data of the older females we have in this dataset.
The sleep disorder "Insomnia" is widely spread in the age group of 40-50 in both male and females.
Physical Activity Level:

The sleep disorder maybe also related to physical activity level as the people who does a lot of physical activity have seen to have "Sleep Apnea" and the people who have "Insomnia" are seen doing less physical activity.

by Occupation: As we have seen that the wide range of individual from Nurse occupation has reported more "Sleep Apnea" than any other occuptation this maybe bacause of lot of physical activity. Also, we can see that the physical activity level of Teacher and Salesperson Occupation lies between 40-50 and they are more likely to report "Insomnia".

BMI Category:

The individuals who are from 'Overweight' & 'Obese' category are more likely to have sleep disorders than that of the Individuals from the 'Normal' & 'Underweight' category. So, this concludes that the physical fitness also plays an important role in the sleep.
As we have seen that the Stress is negatively correlated to the Quality of sleep and also, we can see that the Individuals from 'Obese' & 'Overweight' category have wider and higher range of stress level which may be effecting there quality of sleep too.
Blood Pressure:

The Sleep disorder 'Sleep Apnea' individuals can be seen having higher Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure. It may conclude that, as the females reported for 'Sleep Apnea' more maybe it is caused because of there higher Blood pressure and heart rate than that of males.
Also, the individuals of the 'Obese' & 'Overweight' category are having higher Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure. It concludes, that maybe there higher Blood pressure has been the cause of them reporting for 'Insomnia' and 'Sleep Apnea' more than that of others.

Thank you very much for your interest!

And I would appreciate any comments and recommendations for improvement!
